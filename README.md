This application takes commands and targets and runs the command(s) against all the targets.
Targets can either be enter manually, seperated by commas (ex: 172.0.0.1,172.0.0.2,...,),
or targets can be loaded from a text file, with one target per line. it then displays some
general output from each system letting you know if the command(s) ran correcctly.

# Bugs may be encountered at this stage in development

# More information coming soon!
